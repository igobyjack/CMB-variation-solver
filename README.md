# CMB Variation Solver

Built using a Boltzmann solver, the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS), credit to https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public

The purpose of this project is to experiment with varying values in the Lambda Cold Dark Matter model of the Cosmic Microwave Background, and observe its effects on the power spectrum. 

For the baseline CMB model, I used publicly available data from the Planck Collaboration, Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), and South Pole Telescope (SPT). 

Here are some of the graphs I was able to generate.
